\thispagestyle{empty}

I, \myName, declare that this thesis titled, `\myTitle' and the work presented in it are my own. I confirm that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the thesis comprises only my original work towards the fulfilment of the \textit{\myDegree} degree except where indicated in the preface;
	% \item the main content of some chapters are largely derived from published manuscripts of which I am the first author;
	\item due acknowledgment has been made in the text to all other material used; and
	\item the thesis is fewer than the maximum word limit in length, exclusive of tables, maps, bibliographies and appendices as approved by the Research Higher Degrees Committee.
\end{enumerate}
